     * the Hue channel should be averaged over the shortest arc between the two values.
     * e.g. The average of H_1 = 10 and H_2 = 320 is H_avg = 345 and NOT 165.
     * In the case of two diametric hues being averaged, e.g. 10 and 190, the average will
     * have the smaller value, i.e. 100 and NOT 280.
